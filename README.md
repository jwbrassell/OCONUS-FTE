**Purpose:** This document has been created to track tips that I feel are useful to those who may be working overseas as a DoD civilian contractor for the first time. This isn't a document that covers everything. I won't tell you the minimum items you need. I also recognize that I am one of many that have done this and what worked for me may not be the best advice for you. 

**My Background:** I served in the USAF for 6 years as an RF Telecommunications Technician. I think I got out as a 3D173.  After seperating from the Air Force I hired on with a company and worked in Afghanistan as a field engineer I worked in Afghanistan for about 19 months.  

**While working as a contractor I was able to:**
+ finish my Bachelors degree
+ Earn my CCNA, A+, Sec +
+ Promote in position 

**Since leaving Afghanistan I have:**
+ not gone back to Afghanistan :)
+ secured a job as a network technican within 4 months of being home. Promoted multiple times since then.
+ payed for a townhouse for a year after leaving up front. 
  - this allowed me to take my time finding a job. 
+ Bought my first house. Then some land. Then built on that land. and now we are on our second house. 
+ But mainly, I'm told that of those in our group I did pretty well with my time over there and using the money to change my life. So I am trying to think of what I did and wht it resulted in to show some positivies. 

**My Advice:**
+ Money, it's king
- The Money isn't that great. It can change your life but doesn't for most. 
- For the money you'll make to change your life you'll need to be intentional with it. 
  - Don't spend what you don't have to. 
    - this doesn't mean don't spend anything, but have an allowance of blow money that you can use. Act like you're making usual money. Remember that this lifestyle and the large checks are temporary
