**Purpose:** This document has been created to track tips that I feel are useful to those who may be working overseas as a DoD civilian contractor for the first time. This isn't a document that covers everything. I won't tell you the minimum items you need. I also recognize that I am one of many that have done this and what worked for me may not be the best advice for you. 

**My Background:** I served in the USAF for 6 years as an RF Telecommunications Technician. I think I got out as a 3D173.  After seperating from the Air Force I hired on with a company and worked in Afghanistan as a field engineer I worked in Afghanistan for about 19 months.  

**While working as a contractor I was able to:**
+ finish my Bachelors degree
+ Earn my CCNA, A+, Sec +
+ Promote in position 

**Since leaving Afghanistan I have:**
+ not gone back to Afghanistan :)
+ secured a job as a network technican within 4 months of being home. Promoted multiple times since then.
+ payed for a townhouse for a year after leaving up front. 
  - this allowed me to take my time finding a job. 
+ Bought my first house. Then some land. Then built on that land. and now we are on our second house. 
+ But mainly, I'm told that of those in our group I did pretty well with my time over there and using the money to change my life. So I am trying to think of what I did and wht it resulted in to show some positivies. 

**My Advice:**
+ **Money, it's king**
  - The Money isn't that great. It can change your life but doesn't for most. 
  - For the money you'll make to change your life you'll need to be intentional with it. 
    - Don't spend what you don't have to. 
      - this doesn't mean don't spend anything, but have an allowance of blow money that you can use. Act like you're making usual money. Remember that this lifestyle and the large checks are temporary
  - Have a budget for the time you will be there and break that out into pay periods. I suggest taking a Financial Peace course through Dave Ramsey's program either online or in Person. You can do this even if not of his faith and the advice still applies and I and my wife feel it has served us well.

+ **Suggested Money Goals:**
  - first paycheck, probably in training or CRC: put something into savings. something. 100. 10. start building the habit.
  - by second full paycheck: 
    - 1000 in savings as an emergency fund. 
    - 100 in cash in case of emergency (may not be possible to get cash in some locations)
  - by third full paycheck: 
    - 1000 additional saved and set aside for transportation home. (be prepared to leave if needed. Don't be reliant on the company)
  - 401k:
    - if company has matching, max out on matching rate.  (yes, this takes away money but if you put it in there now while young, and let it sit there the next 20 - 30 years it will be a considerable sum. 
  - Roth:
    - max out contributions for yourself and if you have a spouse
  - Money Engine:
    - 10,000 in an investment account seperate from retirement. not a single stock. Something with good returns like a money market. You let this money run over the time you're there and it helps you get familiar with investing. 
  - Debts: 
    - I don't know your debts. so this part is difficult. 
      - once I had my savings built up, I payed off my credit cards by highest interest rates first, and then put the money into savings and investments.  
  - Charity:
    - be generous but again, remember that this money doesn't last forever. You are there to change your life long term and you'll be able to give more over time.
  - Computer:
    - light weight. can take a beating. have a pack of adapters dont buy something fancy and expect it to last. 
  - check your accounts for any reoccuring services that you can cancel while over there. 
+ **Invest in yourself:**
  - some bases have pearson vue testing centers where you can take certification exams. 
    - you may not be at one. but you can network to find one and try to travel to a larger base for the test. 
  - you can take classes online and still have time to watch the newest tv shows that your co workers spent over a week trying to download one episode of
  - programming is easy to learn. You can learn it for free. Python and Bash. This will help greatly in job searches (in my experience) 
  - take the job seriously. Get excited about new projects or chances to step up. You'll probably learn something new to add to your skill tool set. It will also help to break up the days.
  - do some sort of exercise even if it's just a daily walk.
  - talk to people. don't just stay in the tent / chu waiting for chow or work.
  - The environment that you're working in is not normal. The job is not normal. Talk to people at home and at work. Do not isolate yourself. Yes, you can handle it blah blah but you're still oversears. I'm saying mental health is important. 
  
+ **Job:**
 - treat the customer well. Not just because it's good for the company, but because they are people. build relationships and mentor / help where you can. I found a lot of active duty just wanted to talk about what their options are when they get out. 
 - know your equipment. be it's advocate.
 - be able to draw out and explain signal flow. 
 - understand how to use your test equipment.
 - when you get on site check for your tools, test equipment, the terminal
